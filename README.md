OpenCV install script

Installs all special dependencies needed to build OpenCV with Intel(r) Hardware support.

Tested with Ubuntu 16.04.5 64bit, Ubuntu 17.10 64bit, Ubuntu 18.04.1 64bit.

To begin installation run install_ocv.sh script with no arguments.
If the process fails you can continue by passing the failed step to the script.
For example, if step 3 fails, after you resolve all issues say 'install_ocv.sh step_3' to proceed.

Have a great day and as always, stay awesome!
