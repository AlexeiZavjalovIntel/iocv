OpenCV install script

Installs all special dependencies needed to build OpenCV with Intel(r) Hardware support.

Tested with Ubuntu 16.04.5 64bit.

To begin installation run install_ocv.sh script with no arguments.
If the process fails you can continue by passing the failed step to the script.
For example, if step 3 fails, after you resolve all issues say 'install_ocv.sh step_3' to proceed.

Have a great day and as always, stay awesome!
